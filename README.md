Spike is a fast reverse proxy built on top of [ReactPHP](https://github.com/reactphp) that helps to expose your local services to the internet.

[简体中文](./README-zh_CN.md)

## Installation

Install via composer

```bash
composer global require slince/dragbox

## Configure the server

A public machine that can be accessed on the internet is needed. Assuming already. There are two ways to start the server
 
### Based on defaults

Use the following command to start the server

```bash
$ spiked --address=127.0.0.1:8088
```

The above command can create a basic service. If you want to customize more information, you should start the server based on
the configuration file.

### Based on the configuration file.

- Creates a configuration file

Execute the following command to create it.

```bash
$ spiked init --dir=/home/conf --format=json
```

Yaml,Xml,Ini and Json(default) files are supported. Use the following command for help.


```bash
$ spiked init -h
```

- Open the configuration file and modify the parameters.

- Executes the following command to start the service.
 
```bash
 $ spiked --config=/home/conf/spiked.json
```

## Configure the client.

You should first create a configuration file for the client.

- Execute the following command to create it

```bash
$ spike init --dir=/home/conf --format=json
```
Use the following command for help about this command

```bash
$ spike init -h
```

- Open the configuration file and modify the parameters.

- Start the client service.
 
```bash
$ spike --config=/home/conf/spike.json
```


## Tunnel

The definition of the tunnel only in the client, the server does not need to do any configuration, so as to achieve the most simplified configuration.

> Now supports both http and tcp tunnels

Open the configuration file for the client and modify the parameters for "tunnel".
 
- Add an HTTP tunnel

```json
{
    "protocol": "http",
    "serverPort": 8086,
    "proxyHosts": {
        "www.foo.com": "127.0.0.1:80",
        "www.bar.com": "192.168.1.101:8080"
    }
}
```
Restarts the client service. Visit "http://www.foo.com:8086", the service will be forwarded to the local "127.0.0.1:80"; 
Note that resolve "www.foo.com" to the server IP.

- Add a TCP tunnel

The services based on the tcp can use the tunnel, such as: mysql, redis, ssh and so on; The following is an example of proxy mysql service

```json
{
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "serverPort": 8087,
    "host": "127.0.0.1:3306"
}
```

Execute the following command to visit the local mysql service.

```bash
$ mysql -h SERVER IP -P 8087
```

## Client authentication

The authentication is not enabled on the server based on defaults.You should start the server based on configuration file,
if you want to enable this.

- Enable authentication

Open the configuration file for the server and modify parameters for "auth" and restart the service.

> Currently only supports a simple user name password authentication, more authentication methods will be added later.

- Modify the client identity information

Open the configuration file for the client and modify parameters for "auth". Keep the same parameters as the server.


## Configure log

The default to open the console and file two forms of the log; the first will print the logs to the console; the second 
will write all the logs to the specified file;  Default log level is "info"; You can adjust this in the configuration file.
